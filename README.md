## Architecture

The application follows a microservices architecture:

- **API Gateway**: Routes requests to appropriate services
- **Auth Service**: Handles user authentication and authorization
- **Product Service**: Manages product-related operations
- **PostgreSQL**: Centralized database for all services

## Services

### API Gateway
- Routes requests to auth and product services
- Handles 404 errors for undefined routes

### Auth Service
- User registration
- User login with JWT token generation
- Role-based access control

### Product Service
- CRUD operations for products
- Role-based access to certain operations

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL
